Main Features
=============

The program itself is comprised of the following java files:
- ParseThesaurus.java : This class parses the MobyThesaurus2.txt into a treemap. This will then be used in conjunction with another map (Google 1000 words) to create another map.
- ParseGoogleWords.java: This class parses the 1000 Google words into a Treemap. This will then be used to compare/associate the 1000 to the whole thesaurus.
- Runner.java: This class runs the whole application.
- ConsoleColour.java: This class is used to customise the actual Shell Console so that simplified words are returned in a different colour than the unchanged words.
- ThesaurusToGoogleWords.java: This class is used to compare the Google 1000 words with the thesaurus.
- SentenceToStringRunner.java: This class runs the search and replace functionality of the application. each word is compared to the key value (i.e. the 1000 words) and returns to the end user.
